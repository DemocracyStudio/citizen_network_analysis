This repo contains my Social Network Analysis in Python. It contains topological  feature extraction from twitter datasets and machine learning on graphs.

The following steps through my study are : 

- Twitter datasets to graphs

- Feature extraction from graph files https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jUGaFdRpAjPpWLhKklGQcdSdX2-0Mbsg/view?usp=sharing

- Feature extraction for link prediction

- Statistical analysis on graph https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sr7gjbL9CxCzTMeUg2LDkZjb2QgZBDM1/view?usp=sharing 

- community detection with machine learning

- link prediction with machine learning
